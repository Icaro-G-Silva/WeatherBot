# Weather-Bot
> Basic weather bot with precious information about climate

# How does it work?
It's very simple because it uses only two APIs to work:
+ openWeather
+ SMTP (Email)

with **openWeather** we can catch some informations about the weather and then, with **SMTP** we send that information to someone's email.
Particularly in this bot, we can also set a specific time to send the weather's infos.
